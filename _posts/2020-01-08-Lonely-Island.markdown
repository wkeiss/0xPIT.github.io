This is a project names Lonely Island built by Django.

It's a simple page, with it you can post your small thoughts. People only can see your thought, but can't commnet. I built the Web Applicaiton since I hope there is somewhere on the Internet that I can escape the social network to stay alone and write down some small thoughts, rather than when I open Twitter or Weibo, there are a lot of message streams catching my attentions.
