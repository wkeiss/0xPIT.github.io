## About Me

Hi, I am Cindy. Welcome to my site! <br>

I am searching a path to be developer and live a happy life. I am interested in building something that creative and valuable, I hope I can use technology to solve some problems and provide happiness to others. For a newbid, I know there is a long way to where I want to go, but I will continuously search, try and fail. This site is used to record my exploring path. <br>

Thanks for coming here, nice to meet you~ ：）
